              I've heard of them, where the strings are doubled, but yours are 
              individual strings. What is up with that??</em></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">I just 
              felt like expanding the palettes a bit. The 8-strings have a lot 
              of different features than my 7's do. To start with, they are both 
              3 octave necks which gives me a range of 71 notes, from below the 
              range of a piano to above the range of most guitars. Because of 
              the way I tune them, F#-B-E-A-D-G-B-E, I lose a note - oh boy - 
              but that is still a big leap from my 7's (57 notes on my 28 fret 
              7-strings) and light years from the &quot;normal&quot; 4 string, 
              which gives a usable range of only 39 notes on a 24 fret neck.They 
              have a longer scale length, 35&quot; instead of 34&quot;, which 
              I wanted to experiment with. They also have custom Music Man pickups 
              in them, which I had specially made by <a href="http://www.seymourduncan.com">Seymour 
              Duncan</a>. The electronics are pretty intense too; they have the 
              usual 3-band eq that I like in all my basses, but they also have 
              a fully Parametric Eq band, with Q, cut/boost, and frequency. They 
              have piezo pickups in the bridge that not only give the most excellent 
              representation of an upright that I have ever heard from an electric, 
              they also interface with a synthesizer using the Roland 13-pin standard,

            can play any combination of magnetic pickups, piezo pickups and synth 
            at any time. To top it off, the woodworking on these things is another 
            new step for me - Bill Conklin made the fretboard of each bass from 
            the same block that he made the neck from, so the wood stringers through 
            the neck are visible on the fretboard. It really is killer. Furthermore, 
            my 8-string fretless has lines made of bubinga on the highest octave, 
            along with brass dot position markers on the side of the neck - very 
            cool indeed.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><em>What 
              do you think of the longer scale length?</em></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The verdict 
              - no difference, at least none that I can tell. It's a commonly 
              held belief that the longer scale length will give you a better 
              low B, and lower, and in fact I have heard luthiers make the claim 
              that no 34&quot; bass could have the low B response that their 36&quot; 
              instrument has. Well, I have got to tell you, I have my through-body 
              7-string (34&quot; scale length) tuned with a low F#, and it is 
              just as articulate and precise as the low F# on my 35&quot; scale 
              length 8 string. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">I have 
              compared all my <a href="http://www.conklinguitars.com">Conklins</a> 
              at various times to many different basses, including those with 
              a 36&quot; scale length, and I haven't found any that could compare, 
              let alone sound better. I think, and Bill Conklin has backed me 
              up on this, that of MUCH greater importance to the performance of 
              the lower notes is how rigid and well constructed the neck is. Bill's 
              necks are all top notch, completely hand carved, and totally rigid. 
              My basses never even go out of tune. Bill makes the best necks I 
              have ever played, and they reflect in the performance of the instrument.I 
              also think that the mass of the instrument has a lot to do with 
              how well the lower notes will sustain. A vibrating string has momentum 
              based upon its mass. A high pitched string's momentum will be negligible 
              compared to the mass of any bass, but the low F# on my basses is 
              .150&quot; wide. When you pick this thing up you can really feel 
              it. When a string that size vibrates on a bass, you better have 
              a rigid neck, a massive bridge, and hopefully an instrument that 
              isn't going to just vibrate along with the string, dampening it. 
              The way to avoid this is with mass, and let me tell you, that's 
              something my basses have <em>(laughs).</em> </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I really 
              am into Lane Poors, I just wanted a change on these basses. The 
              Lane Poor company philosophy, at least as I understand it, was that 
              the pickups should be as clean and flat and uncolored as possible, 
              and I'll tell you what, I think they hit the nail on the head. The 
              pickups in my 7 strings have got the widest, most even response 
              I have ever heard. </font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">With the 
            8 strings, I was just under the impression that a Music Man pickup 
            has a definite sound to it, and getting something that was just flat, 
            response-wise, seemed to defeat the purpose. Besides, the few Music 
            Man-equipped basses that I played with the <a href="http://www.seymourduncan.com">Seymour 
            Duncan</a> MM pickup in them all sounded fabulous, and the guys at 
            Duncan were really cool and easy to work with, getting the string-to-string 
            dimensions from Bill and basically building the pickups to our specs. 
            I love the pickups, they are really different sounding than those 
            on my other basses, the basses are like these big, mutant 16 lb man-eating 
            Music Men. They are the Music Uber-Mensch, for our Nietzschoids out 
            there.</font></td>

              </em>Actually, I do hear it all the time. I usually tell whoever 
              is asking that most of what I play could be played on a 5 string. 
              Then I say things like &quot;Most guitarists could do most of what 
              they do on a 5 string guitar or less&quot; and &quot;The number 
              of strings ultimately doesn't matter as much as what you do with 
              them&quot;And, if that doesn't work, I finally resort to:</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
              like to think that what I play, whether on the 'Original 4' or on 
              the extended range strings has a uniqueness and a style independent 
              of the instrument that helps to define me as a player - I can and 
              do play classical guitar lines, bass lower than a piano, even synthesizer 
              - I can really do whatever I want. The way our music is constructed, 
              the more creative that I am, the more room and creative freedom 
              that is available to everyone else in the band - it's not like 'time 
              for John's solo, everyone sit out the next 8' - they all have to 
              actually deal with what I am doing. It forces everyone to be more 
              creative, and I like it that way. Although I can't say for certain, 
              I think the guys in the band like it that way too.&quot;</font></p>

            something about 4 strings being enough for Jaco or Jamerson or some 
            other dead hero of the instrument. Sometimes I just have to smile 
            and shrug. I mean, after all, no telling what Jaco would've played 
            if these kinds of instruments were available to him, and besides, 
            ultimately, I am not playing to the ghost of anyone - I like what 
            I do, I absolutely love the feel of bass strings against my fingers, 
            and I love the music that I play. I don't like 4 strings, or anything 
            less than 7 for that matter, and it's my music, my money and my choice.
