      <h1>About Me</h1>	   
  	  <p>I am a computer programmer passionate about Graphics, Simulation and Machine Learning, a <a href="music.html" target="_blank">bass player since 1983</a> 
  	  afflicted with a <a href="lordonly/lojtbas1.htm" target="_blank">30 year fetish for too-many-strings</a>; a collector of Pixar teapots and Carrera slot-cars; 
  	  a husband, father and crazy cat-dude.  I live in Roswell, Georgia, I've been married since 2001, 
  	  I have 3 wonderful <strike>minions</strike> kids (my daughter was born in 2007 and my twin boys in 2011) and, currently, 7 pampered, indoor cats.</p>
      <p>As of April 2022 I have completed a 2 year contract as a research engineer working on the <a href="https://aihabitat.org/" target="_blank">Habitat</a> project, 
      a simulation platform for research in <a href="https://embodied-ai.org/" target="_blank">Embodied AI</a>. My focus has been developing in C++ and python, expanding 
      the functionality, flexibility, stability and dataset support of the simulation platform, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim" target="_blank">Habitat-Sim</a>.  
      I still contribute to the project when I can, and <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">a summary of my contributions can be viewed on Github.</a> 
  	  From October 2013 to November 2016 I also worked full time as a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.ignitionone.com/" target="_blank">IgnitionOne</a>, an independent online marketing company. </p>
      
      <p>Although I graduated from Georgia Tech in 1992 with a degree in Electrical Engineering, professionally I've always been a programmer.  Through the 90's I worked
      in client-server development(One of the systems I wrote a code generator in Pascal that took screen descriptions from AS400 COBOL and generated Windows UI code) 
      and telecom (writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank">IVR/VRU</a> scripts, among other things).  In the 2000's I worked as a contractor/consultant on 
      web-based business applications C# using various Microsoft platforms such as ASP and ASP.NET.</p>
      
      <p>In 2010 I decided to go back to school and re-enrolled at Tech as a full-time Undergraduate CS student.  Although Tech gave me credit for the 
      classes I took for my first degree (a mixed blessing since I was a mediocre student the first time around) I decided to retake all my undergraduate Calculus classes. After all, it 
      had been 18 years since I had been in a class room, and the most complex math I had to perform since then was calculating a tip.  Surprisingly enough, 
      I discovered that I loved math, and was pretty good at it too, after kicking off the rust.  Enough that I felt I had to find a way to fold math into my career and my life, somehow. 
      And then, along came graphics, which is just digital art realized through the application of linear algebra and trig, and then physically-based simulation, which is effectively animating 
      graphics in a physically plausible way through discrete approximations of differential calculus, and I found the loves of my intellectual life.      
      In December 2016 I received my Master's degree from <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> with a specialization in Graphics and Physically-based Simulation.</p>
      
      <p>Academically, for me at least, the 2nd time was the charm.  As both an Undergraduate and a Master's student, I've earned a 4.0 GPA and TA'ed 9 different Computer Science classes 
      (6 as undergrad, 2 as GTA).  In <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/annual-awards-and-honors-past-recipients" target="_blank">April 2015 I was awarded both 
      the Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant and The Donald V. Jackson Fellowship by the Georgia Tech College of Computing.</a></p>

	<h1>PhD Adventure</h1>
	<p>In Fall of 2017 I started pursuing a PhD with Professor Karen Liu, focusing on using Reinforcement Learning to derive control for a robot so that 
	it could provide appropriate assistive force to a biped agent to get up.</p>
