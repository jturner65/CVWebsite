		<p>Masters of Computer Science (2014-Dec 2016) - GPA : 4.0.
		<br>All CS(24) and Math(5) classes required for Bachelor of Computer Science specializing in Modeling and Simulation and Media (2010-2014) - GPA : 4.0.
		<br>Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (1986-1992) </p>
		
		<h3>Academic Awards</h3>
		<p>2014 Outstanding Graduate TA 
		<br>2014 The Donald V. Jackson Fellowship  </p>
		
		<h3>Languages That I have worked extensively in</h3>
		<p><span style="padding-left:2em">C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, MATLAB, MEL script, Pascal, Python, R, SQL.</span> 
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">I have delivered software products professionally in C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Pascal, Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Visual Basic since 1992.</span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">I have TA'ed classes at Tech that required expertise in C, C++, Java, OpenGL, and Python.</span>  
		<br><br>I have implemented numerous stable applications where cross-platform execution was required such as Java calling C++ via JNI, Java calling MATLAB via Java Matlab Interface, 
		C++ simulation code calling and managing MATLAB to collect and format simulation data, Python web server calling and managing R environments and scripts which then 
		interact with various SQL servers, and others.  <br>
		<br>I've used various Machine Learning libraries in Matlab, Python, Java or C++, such as Weka (Java) to work with supervised learning tasks, 
		SHARK (C++) to perform randomized optimization, (specifically unimodal CMA-ES), MatConvNet and Torch for Computer Vision/Deep Learning, particularly convolutional nets and LSTMs,
		and SOMOCLU (C++) to build self organized maps.<br>
		<br>I've implemented a full Kinect Library in C++ that included IK, voice recognition, hand state tracking (via my own implementation of a Neural Net w/Back Propagation) 
		and a suite of Kinect-friendly UI constructs such as sliders, levers, buttons, textboxes and check boxes.</p>		
		<h3>Work and Research Experience</h3>
		<h5>Ignition One : 8/14 to present. Data Scientist/Algorithmic Specialist</h5>
		<p>Built Linux/Python-based Tornado web servers to manage multiple instances of R environment running various analytic processes on clients' 
		advertising performance. Some of the other projects I'm working on or have completed :
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">(R ref classes, SQL) Perform moments analysis of client revenue and spend over product sold and time series data.</span> 
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">(R ref classes, SQL) Perform regression on advertising budgets to predict optimal spend across different ad channels. 
		<a href = "http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=14%2F887600&OS=14/887600&RS=14/887600">We have applied for a patent for this system.</a></span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">(R, SQL)Build a predictive model of capitalizable user behavior using a single hidden layer (piece-wise linear) neural net with over 95% accuracy.  Turns out folks aren't that complicated in their surfing habits.</span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">(C++, SQL)Modified an existing C++ Self Organizing Map library for our needs and used it to find "look-alikes" in user pool - folks whose behavior looks like other folks known to "convert" (perform some capitalizable action).</span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">Multiple Visualization tools to facilitate intuitive understanding of high dimensional data.</span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">Analyze and predict trends in inherently chaotic time series data using non-parametric algorithms such as Singular Spectrum Analysis.</span></p>
		<h5>Ignition One : 10/13 to 8/14. Senior Software Engineer</h5>
		<p>Part of a team of 14 developers working in an AGILE-based behavior-driven development environment.  Co-designed and implemented web-based C# and Javascript, dot.net 
		CQRS platform for large scale advertising client management system.  Among the features of this system I implemented was an outlier analysis and reporting system using Math.NET, 
		a dot.net library for numerical	computing.</p>
		<h5>Georgia Tech : 1/15 to present. Graduate Teaching Assistant</h5>
		<p>TA'ed Undergraduate and Graduate Computer Animation class (CS 4496/7496 taught by Prof. Karen Liu) in Spring 2015,Spring 2016 and Fall 2016. 
		I helped students learn MEL scripting in Maya and to code (in C++) particle, rigid body (Baraff/Witkin) and fluid (Stam) simulations, and IK solver. 
		Lectured CS7496 on Fluid Dynamics Simulation using Eulerian Grids. Proctored and graded final exams.</p>
		<p>TA'ed Graduate Graphics course (CS 6491 taught by Professor Jarek Rossignac) in Fall 2015.  Graded all submitted assignments, projects and exams, 
		assisted students in understanding and implementing optimized particle simulations, steady affine motion and morphs,  3D curve averaging. Derived 
		mechanism for students to implement all questions from a difficult mid-term as part of regrade process. Responsible for final grades with approval of Professor.</p>
		<h5>Georgia Tech : 5/13 to present.  Undergraduate/Graduate Research Assistant</h5>
		<p>Hired (for credit) by Professor Karen Liu to code C++ Microsoft SDK-based Kinect library to be used with DART animation/physics simulation library, 
		using motion-capture/IK solver,Voice and Gesture Recognition (included Neural Net to classify hand state) and custom Kinect-based UI components sliders, 
		textboxes, levers, CBs.</p>  
		<p>Implemented C++/DART version of <a href="https://mediatech.aalto.fi/publications/graphics/C-PBP/">Control-PBP algorithm (Hämäläinen et al. 2015).</a></p>
		<p>Implemented C++ <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/Simbicon.htm">SIMBICON state-machine-based</a> bipedal locomotion controller in DART. </p>
		<p>Implemented data capture protocol via MATLAB being launched in C++ to transparently collect and analyze performance of various biped controllers, such as SIMBICON,
		 in comparison to biomech benchmark data of human motion along numerous metrics, such as gait duty cycle and ground reaction force.  Used CMA-ES to improve controllers based on small dimensional data using worst performing biomech benchmarks. </p>
		<h5>Georgia Tech : 5/12 to 5/13 Undergraduate Research Assistant</h5>
		<p>Hired by Professor Greg Turk (8/12-5/13 for pay) as an undergraduate RA, working over three semesters on simulations of fluid erosion, where fractally 
		generated (Square-Square subdivision – Musgrave '89) and procedurally generated terrain was eroded using height-field 
		fluids governed by shallow water equations in a closed system.  Developed novel approaches for eroding adjacent dry terrain (mass wasting) 
		and transporting sediment during fluid transport calculation (Semi-Lagrangian method) as well as simultaneous Aeolian erosion (wind).  
		As part of this project I also built a full UI using OpenGL able to completely control all simulation parameters, analyze results and visualize processes such as fluid velocity, sediment motion, etc.</p>
		<h5>Georgia Tech : 1/11 to 5/14. Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h5>
		<p>TA'ed 6 different CS courses : CS 1050 Discrete Mathematics and Proofs, CS 1331 Intro to OOP (Java), CS 2110 Computer Organization
