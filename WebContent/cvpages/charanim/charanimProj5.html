      <p>For my part of this project, I took the author's implementation of a SIMBICON walking controller, added code that would transparently 
      collect performance data from the controller and save this data as MATLAB matrices by calling MATLAB 
      from within the C++ code and populating variables within the MATLAB environment.  This enabled a fast and transparent 
      data collection mechanism for offline analysis that imapcted the controller performance minimally (there was only 1 
      point of data collection for each simulation step). </p>
      <p>This data was then compared to Biomechanically collected human walking data, inverted and double pendulum simulations, and other
      Biomech paradigms of human walking motion to provide an objective criteria for rating controllers.  We also worked with the Generalized 
      Biped, Terrain Adaptive, and the BiologicalBase controllers, and compared the results to provide objective criteria that matched the 
      intuitive sense of the appropriateness of the motion of each controller.</p>
      <p>I also felt that the Biomech-collected data could be used to perform informed optimization to improve the controllers.  While using
      human data to optimize controllers is not new, in the existing literature the optimization space was very high dimensional - over 130 
      variables in one case.  Instead, I felt that by targeting only those benchmarks that a controller deviated from the most, and optimizing only a 
      few dofs constrained by these benchmarks, the problem could be reduced in complexity and overhead, while the controller's overall performance could be 
      improved.</p>
      <p>For example, by using arm swing and duty factor (the % of time each foot is on the ground) as constraints, and optimizing the ankle and toe 
      trajectories of the swing and stance foot at 3 control points each, we improved the overall performance of the SIMBICON controller in nearly every 
      criteria, including those such as ground reaction force profile, that wouldn't seem to be directly related to the optimization parameters.  Our conclusion was that these results inferred 
      that these simple Biomech-inspired benchmark criteria successfully encoded what it was to have an "appropriate" biped walk in much less data than a full analysis of the walking motion itself.</p>
