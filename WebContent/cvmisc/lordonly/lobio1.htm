            <p align="right"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The band that would 
              be Lord Only started when Hal and John met through an ad in an Atlanta, 
              GA, newspaper. Finding each other to be remarkably similar in musical 
              tastes and styles of playing, they began working together on original 
              material. Within 2 months, they had completed, together, 7 songs 
              which are still integral parts of the band's set list. Although, 
              with the drummer, they were only a trio at the time, they both agreed 
              that a fourth member, probably another guitarist, would be necessary 
              to fulfill and even augment the musical ideas they shared, so they 
              began looking for a suitable individual. They also began looking 
              for a new drummer who could handle, with fluidity and power, the 
              technical demands their music made. The search proved difficult, 
              and they stopped working together for a time to find their bearings. 
              John began to play with a drummer and a guitarist in a trio, working 
              on some of the material he co-wrote with Hal, as well as some new 
              material in a different stylistic direction, and Hal soon rejoined 
              John in this new band, which became the first incarnation of Lord 
              Only. The band lasted for about two years, writing and gigging, 
              but the other musicians did not share the vision that Hal and John 
              shared, so they left the band, and Hal and John again took another 
              hiatus from working together. </font></p>
            <p align="right"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">At about this time, 
              Brian was leading a band of his own, with a keyboardist, drummer 
              and his brother Jason on bass. John heard that Brian's brother wasn't 
              really interested in playing anymore, so he got in touch with Brian, 
              and found him to be a real kindred spirit, and they decided to work 
              together. While the band that they were in did not last long, their 
              musical partnership did, and when John decided to buy a house and 
              build a studio, Brian was there with hammer and nails. As the studio 
              began to take shape, Hal came back into the picture and the search 
              for a suitable drummer commenced. One of the drummers interviewed 
              was Jim. Experienced and creative, Jim was able to understand the 
              vision the other three shared and augment it, and the line-up was 
              finally complete. This was in October of 1994.</font></p>

              but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable

              to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid"</font></p>
            <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="1">-Soren Kierkegaard from 
              <u>Fear and Trembling</u></font></p>
            <p align="right"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Written over 150 years 
              ago, those words still ring true when used to describe the music 
              industry today. Styles of playing and writing are the same as they 
              were 40 years ago. The technology may have changed, but the basic 
              art is the same. Even the role each instrument plays in a modern 
              electric group is the same, and has been approached the same way, 
              with precious little deviation, since the '50's. One of the major 
              musical visions the members in the band share is to try and counter 
              this disturbing trend without being just an eclectic musician's 
              band. Stylistically, each instrument's part is approached as being 
              an integral part in both the overall harmony and rhythmic structures 
              of each of the songs. Drawing harmonic ideas from influences as 
              diverse as Rush, King's X, old U2, Yes and the Beatles, and the 
              great rhythm sections of Motown and the 70's and 80's, the members 
              of Lord only are constantly trying to expand their musical palettes 
              without losing the basic concepts of melody, harmony and rhythm 
              that remain approachable to the average music listener and fan. 
              Extended range instruments, guitar-synthesizers and bass-synthesizers 
              are the standard instruments, and even voice synthesizers have found 
              their way into Lord Only's music. In a time where originality is 
              looked down upon as patently un-commercial, Lord Only has set out 
              to make a new mold.</font></p>
