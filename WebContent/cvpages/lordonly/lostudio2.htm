            <p><font color="#003333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'studio 
              concept', for me,&nbsp;originated in 1993, when I realized that 
              if I wanted to get a recording of my music, I was going to have 
              to do it myself. &nbsp;I began to research equipment, techniques, 
              and, most importantly, construction methods! &nbsp;I also began 
              to put aside as much money as I could, for a down-payment for a 
              house. &nbsp;I was living at my parent's house at the time, paying 
              only a small token rent, and I had a good job with minimal bills, 
              so I was able to afford to save a large sum of money along with 
              the purchase of my first Conklin 7-string bass - the frettless. 
              &nbsp;Those were the days. &nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font color="#003333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the 
              time, I was between bands - the earlier incarnation of Lord Only 
              had just dissolved, and I was about to begin working with Brian 
              in his band, Remnant. &nbsp;Quickly, I found him to be a kindred 
              spirit, and I shared many of my plans and schemes with him. &nbsp;Incidentally, 
              Devil's Advocate and Predator of Dreams were composed by him and 
              me in that band, with most of the main riffs of Devil's Advocate 
              being written by us the first day we worked together. &nbsp;To paraphrase 
              Dickens a bit, It was the best of starts...</font> </p>

              I have finally converted my big, empty basement into a Studio and

              Studio itself being an L-shaped room taking up the rest of the space. 
              &nbsp;The walls surrounding the control room are actually double 
              single-stud walls, with about three inches of space between them, 
              for a total thickness of about 1'. &nbsp;There is a triple-pane 
              plexi-glass window between the studio and the control room, 4' wide

              all the way around the studio, 2" to 3" from the outside house wall. 
              &nbsp;I built locking "lids" of particle board and 2x4's to cover 
              the windows, and put up solid core doors in the room itself to help 
              keep down the noise transmission. &nbsp;I think if I never see a 
              roll of Owen's-Corning again, it will be too soon, and I am sure

              &nbsp;At this time I bought the Mackie console, the first of our 
              four ADATs, the Lexicon unit, a pair of SM-57's, the Aphex 107,
