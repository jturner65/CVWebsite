            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">In early 
              1993, I was feeling pretty bored with the concept of a 4-string 
              bass. &nbsp;I was playing a <a
href="http:/www.pedulla.com/mvp.htm">Pedulla</a> Buzz fretless, a nice, mid 70's 
              <a
href="http:/www.fender.com/cgi/doGuitar.cgi?c/guitars_basses/elecbasses+AmerStdJ-BassMpl">Fender</a>

              4001, all three of which are beautiful instruments, and I still 
              own them, but I was becoming increasingly unmotivated by their format. 
              Now, that's not to say that I was some monster player who had completely 
              mastered the world of 4-strings, which is definitely not true; it's 
              just that I wasn't as hungry for bass anymore, or at least not 4-string, 
              and that bothered me. &nbsp;I knew I had to do something about it, 
              so I decided to upgrade to a 6-string. </font></p>

              would be <a href="http://www.conklinguitars.com/">Conklins</a>. 
              &nbsp;They're made by a really cool company in Springfield, Missouri. 
              &nbsp;I saw a giveaway in <a
href="http://www.bassplayer.com/">Bass Player</a> [magazine] in 1993, where the 
              featured prize was this <a
href="http://www.conklinguitars.com/">Conklin</a> 7-string bass. &nbsp;I took 
              a look at it and cried out &quot;Hot Carrots! That will definitely 
              not be boring.&quot; &nbsp;I called the company, and spoke to Bill 
              [Conklin, the owner and master luthier] himself. &nbsp;That impressed 
              me. &nbsp;We had a nice long talk about woods and pickups, and when 
              I hung up the phone, I felt really, really excited about bass again, 
              for probably the first time in eight years. &nbsp;One of the really 
              relevant and &nbsp;important factors for me from the start, when 
              dealing with <a
href="http://www.conklinguitars.com/">Conklin</a>, was the customer service. &nbsp;Bill 
              didn't know me from some guy on the street, but he still treated 
              me with respect and honor, and believe me, that is rare anywhere 
              in the music business, no matter who you are. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">The first 
              7-string that I got from Bill was my fretless, (Serial # 16), which 
              I got in December '93. &nbsp;This&nbsp;bass&nbsp;has a few customizations 
              of my own choosing, although it's still pretty much a stock instrument, 
              as far as Conklins go. &nbsp;The string spacing at the nut more 
              approximates a Jazz bass, maybe even a bit closer together. The 
              finger board is highly figured ebony, 24-fret, and it used to have 
              a high-gloss urethane finish on it, which I just recently had Bill&nbsp;refinish, 
              due to wear from extensive playing, and replace with a clear epoxy. 
              It has a through-body, maple and purpleheart neck and a 34&quot; 
              scale&nbsp;length. The body is ash, with a tightly flamed maple 
              top.&nbsp;Originally, I wanted a clear black or purple finish over 
              the maple flames, but Bill convinced me to keep it just the plain 
              wood because of the porous nature of this particular flamed maple 
              top, and I am glad he did. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My next 
              7-string was my fretted, about a year later, and this had even more 
              customizations (Serial # TurnerII). &nbsp;I call it the &quot;Blood 
              Bass&quot;, and there are many unique features on this instrument, 
              even for a Conklin. &nbsp;The neck is 28-fret, with the same string 
              spacing as the fretless, and is made of wenge, maple and purple-heart-- 
              I think it is the first neck that Bill [Conklin] has ever done like 
              that. &nbsp;It's a [neck] through-body, like the fretless, and the 
              body wood is ash, again like the fretless. &nbsp;The design on the 
              top is not painted, it's actually woods of different colors-- Conklin 
              calls it the Melted top-- and the body design extends both into 
              the through-body portion of the neck and the ebony fretboard. &nbsp;The 
              bright red wood on top-- the &quot;blood&quot; - &nbsp;is purple 
              heart, and the dark brown, figured wood on the bottom is ziricote, 
              a Mexican ebony. &nbsp;He finished the bass with a darker, golden 
              lacquer-like finish that makes the instrument look really aged, 
              like it's a hundred years old. </font></p>

            electronics on the fretted are also pretty customized. &nbsp;The pick-ups 
            were Bartolinis, but I have replaced them with Lane Poor pickups with 
            a volume and pan knob, and Bass, Mid and Treble tone controls, the 
            same as my fretless. The pre-amp was a stock Bartolini, but I have 
            replaced that with a <a
href="http://www.demeteramps.com/basspres.html">Demeter</a> on-board pre-amp. 
            &nbsp;The bass is also outfitted with a Piezo bridge, with its own 
            special rack unit, where I can control from the rack my level and 
            pan for each string individually. &nbsp;Bill had been doing Piezo 
            bridges for some time, but this was the first bass he ever made that 
            had the pan and level control off-instrument-- usually it was controlled 
            by switches on the back or hardwired in some configuration. &nbsp;It 
            was a little bumpy initially-- we had a&nbsp;few headroom problems, 
            but we fixed those, and now the unit rocks. &nbsp;</font></td>

              the results so much that I went back and had the same setup put 
              on the fretless, so both of my workhorse basses have the Piezo bridge 
              setup. &nbsp;I use them [the piezos] in conjunction with the magnetic 
              pickups for recording, and every song features it somewhere, often 
              just for a subtle hinting of stereo-- when mixed with a little chorus 
              or flange it can make the bass really lush-sounding. I am now in 
              the process of replacing the piezo preamp with the <a href="www.rmcpickup.com">RMC 
              Piezo/Synth</a> preamp on both of my neck-through 7-strings, which 
              will not only get me better piezo response, but also the 13-pin 
              Roland standard Synthesizer/C-V output, for <a href="lojtsyn1.htm">bass

              into orderable packages. Mine has a melted top on a cherry wood 
              body, a purple heart fingerboard on a bolt on neck, Lane Poor pickups 
              and a Seymour-Duncan active pre-amp like the one in my doubleneck

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">I recently 
              designed a new fretless neck for it, based on the fretted neck of 
              the doubleneck. It has a maple fretboard with purple heart flame 
              tongues coming from the nut and the pickups. I originally intended 
              on having it fretted, and then changed my mind at the last minute, 
              hence the lines, which I usually don't like on fretless. Sounds 
              great, now I finally have a Lane Poor equipped fretless, and plays 
              like butter. I just have to get used to the lines now - they're 
              actually a bit confusing for me after 8 years of playing fretless 
              7 string without lines.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033"><em>How 
              do you tune them?</em> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000033">Low to 
              high, B-E-A-D-G-B-E, except for my first fretted, which I tune low 
              to high F#-B-E-A-D-G-C. &nbsp;I chose the guitar tuning originally, 
              when I got my fretless, to help me figure out what to do with the 
              top two strings. &nbsp;The low B came naturally-- it was like &quot;Where 
              have you been all my life?&quot;-- but the two high ones were more 
              of a stumper. &nbsp;I had definite plans for them, but I needed 
              to learn the map, so to speak, and there weren't too many guys teaching 
              7-string bass, so I was on my own. &nbsp;I could have just practiced 
              scales, I guess, but that wouldn't be any fun, so my rationale for 
              the tuning was that I would learn guitar parts to cover tunes that 
              I already knew the bass lines for, from way back in my cover tune 
              days; then, eventually I would have a better perspective on where 
              to play certain types of passages in different keys. The new tuning 
              on my fretted, with the low F#, almost an octave lower than a regular 
              4-string bass, really opened up a lot of opportunities for me - 
              I can play passages articulately that would have normally required 
              a synthesizer. I love it.</font></p>

              I went directly from fretted and&nbsp;lined fretless 4-string to 
              an unlined fretless 7. &nbsp;Do not pass Go. &nbsp;I remember when 
              I first got the bass from Bill. &nbsp;I opened the case and stared 
              down at it and started to shake [<em>laughs</em>]. &nbsp;&quot;What 
              have I done?? What have I done?&quot; I kept thinking to myself. 
              &nbsp;To top it off, right after I got it, I went to the '94 <a
href="http://www.namm.com/tradeshow/tradeshow.shtml">Winter Namm</a> show, [the 
              yearly musical instrument trade show in Anaheim CA], which is like 
              the musician's equivalent to the Miss Nude Universe pageant-- a 
              bunch of shred- and chop-meisters vying for cock-o'-the-walk honors, 
              and here I am with two weeks experience on this beast. &nbsp; Everyone 
              likes to say that chops don't matter, but in a situation like that, 
              they are the only thing that matters. Exhibitors at the show&nbsp;only 
              take you seriously if they recognize you or you blow them away, 
              and neither was happening for me. &nbsp;I was having a hard time 
              talking to some people about potential new gear-- they would blow 
              me off.&nbsp;It was, quite honestly, one of the most uncomfortable 
              situations in my life, sort of like swim suit weather sneaking up 
              on you right after Thanksgiving. &nbsp;That show was also the first 
              time I met Bill Conklin, which made it even worse-- here he made 
              me this fabulous instrument, and I couldn't even reliably fret the 
              same string I was plucking! It was pretty bad. &nbsp;I'm over it 
              now, but I still cringe when I&nbsp;think of it. </font></p>
