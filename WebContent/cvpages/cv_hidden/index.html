<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I put this webpage together to briefly (5 min read) demonstrate a few of my recent projects that I feel you might find the most relevant to your team's research that I don't have elsewhere documented yet.  
The first project was the primary project of my PhD so far, working with Professor Karen Liu, while the other project was mostly an independent pursuit.</p>
<p>Neither of these projects resulted in a paper, which illustrates my greatest weakness as a researcher (namely knowing "When is enough enough? (i.e. Time to Stop Working and Write the paper!)")
which is the area I feel I need the most guidance in.</p>
<h3>Assistive Getup - Using VF Approximation to Derive Optimal Assistance.</h3>
<p>(Started Fall 2017) This project had been my primary project as a PhD so far.  The underlying hypothesis was that, given an environment consisting of an Agent Needing Assistance(ANA), and an Assisting Bot (BOT), the 
trained baseline function (used to stabilize training and reduce variance between epochs/policy updates) will act like a Value function approximator, and if the BOT's assistance (i.e. a force vector applied to ANA) is included as part of
ANA's state then this VF approximator could be used via optimization to propose the best assistance for any given state.</p>
    <table id="GetUpClipTbl1" >
      <tr><td><a href="../../cvexclips/cv_hidden/assistGetUp1.mp4">Assistive Getup</a></td></tr>
      <tr><td><video width="800" height="600" autoplay loop><source src="../../cvexclips/cv_hidden/assistGetUp1.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></td></tr>
   	</table>    
<p>In the video, The ANA figure shown on the left is responding to a random trajectory providing assistance in the form of a 3D force vector, using a policy to derive control torques given 
pose q, angular joint velocity qdot and assistive force vector (in 3 D).  This ANA is forward simulated a single step to derive contact information.  The coupled ANA-BOT pair on the right 
are consuming the same policy, but the BOT is providing the assistance force via derived Optimal Control using the assistance proposal provided by the Value Function Optimization.</p>
<p>The problem with this project was that the results proved inconclusive.  While in the example above, the improved behavior is evident, many configurations did not exhibit such definitive results, with some performing no better despite optimal assistance proposals.</p>        
<p>Initially we worked in 2D, with a partial humanoid (waist-down) with a much smaller state (16 dofs vs 33) and in this case the VF approximator provided a good optimal force proposal, 
but as the state grew in size, the VF approx seemed to suffer from the increased dimension and yielded a much less definitive force proposal.</p>

<h3>CondGANCameraman : Teaching a CondGAN about Camera Transformations and Variable Length Sequences using Synthesized Training Data.</h3>
<p>(Spring 2017)  This project I worked on mostly independently, although I initially began investigating GAN's at Professor Liu's suggestion.  The hypothesis here was that, using a properly configured classification 
component the generator could be trained to produce desired sequences of any duration and exhibiting active camera transformations that it had never seen during training. </p>

      <tr><td><video width="800" height="800" autoplay loop><source src="../../cvexclips/cv_hidden/rndGenExample.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></td></tr>
   	</table>    
<p>I synthesized millions of training data consisting of variable length sequences of images of a biped moving its right arm in a trajectory of a lower case English letter (a-z).  I varied the camera location and orientation for each 
sample trajectory, along with the colors and shapes of the head and hand, but all of these components remained fixed throughout the training trajectory.  All of these descriptive components of each training trajectory were encoded in the 
class vector component of the GAN.  I encoded the letter of the trajectory as a 1-hot vector, the camera position and orientation as matrices and quaternions, respectively, and the colors and location of 
each frame within the sequence as a "floating point" 1 hot of length 10 each, where the percentage of progress or color was encoded between 2 adjacent values within the span of the 1-hot vector with a sum of 1.0 - similar to a progress bar. </p>
<p>Once the CondGAN was trained, I was able to synthesize sequences, as shown below, that not only varied in duration but also varied the camera orientation/distance during the trajectory, 
as can be seen in the examples below.  Across each row the letters a-z are being drawn - some of the trajectories are clipped but most are surprisingly coherent.  The duration of the trajectories is determined by how quickly the progress bar/floating point 1-hot evolves.
(Sorry these are so small, click on the titles and they will open in bigger window). </p>
    <table id="CondGanClipTbl2" >
      <tr><td><a href="../../cvexclips/cv_hidden/gestIKcondCam1.mp4">Generator Output</a>. These trajectories vary in length.  Across each row, a-z is demonstrated (except the last row of course, which was truncated due to the limitations of my video card) while each row is progressivly slower in duration. </td></tr>

   	</table>    
<p>An interesting discovery was that to synthesize a coherent trajectory, I needed to keep the noise vector <b>fixed</b> throughout the trajectory.  By varying the other conditional class tags, the trajectory is evolved. 
 One consequence of this is that many more unique trajectories are possible than were seen in training - for each fixed noise vector, a particular trajectory exhibiting certain characteristics can be synthesized.</p> 
 <p>I believe that synthesizing reasonable training data would be helpful for many ML tasks, and the ability of the GAN to produce reasonable camera transformations was surprising, at least to me.  I never put this together as a paper only because, as 
 I started working on my PhD officially, I was focused on RL and control tasks.  I'm not sure if there's anything here that is particularly novel or worthy of further exploration but if so I would be interested in pursuing it further.</p>
