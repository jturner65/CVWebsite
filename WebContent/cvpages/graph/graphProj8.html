      <p>This was the biggest project for Jarek Rossignac's Graduate Computer Graphics class.  As with a few other projects, I worked with another student on this, 
      although I ended up implementing ~95% of the project by myself, as well as implementing some extra functionality, like free-form loops and rotational axes, 
      that seemed to me to be "appropriate" for a tool like this.  We had to support drawing two shapes and a rotational 
      axis, and then implment various kinds of morphs between these shapes, which would be rotated around the axis (which 
      might not be straight) to generate a lathed-like mesh.</p>  
      <p>The primary objective of this project is to generate a 3D mesh by revolving a 2D stroke about a spine.
			This simple idea is made more complex by including functionality to morph between two strokes, to
			define a variable thickness, and to bend the spine. The result produces very interesting 3D shapes.
			The concepts used in building this application have a variety of applications, such as designing parts
			using a computer aided design system, or animating a figure between two keyframes.</p>  
		<p>Our application lets the user define a series of weighted control points that define a variable thickness
		stroke. The weight at each point corresponds to the radius of the polyloop bounding the stroke at
		each point. The radius of each point is given an initial value based on the velocity of the mouse as the
		user was drawing the points. By default, slower mouse movements result in smaller radii, but we
		gave the option to invert this behavior. The user defined points are then smoothed
		and resampled, resulting in a fixed number of control points that are evenly spaced. Additionally, a
		linear interpolation is used to smooth the width of each point.
		We have implemented three different types of offsets to define the offset curve: normal, ball and
		radial.</p><p>The normal offset was the most trivial to implement. The offset polyloop positions are found by
		adding the normal, scaled by the radius, to the control point for each control point in the stroke. For
		the radial offset, instead of defining the polyloop positions based on the normals we compute them
		by finding the intersection points of circles centered at adjacent control points. For a point where
		there is a small overlap between that point’s circle and the adjacent point’s circle, the normal position
		is used for that point. For a large overlap, we find the two positions where the circles intersect and
		use those for the offset points. The ball offset is found similarly, however instead of having one circle
		centered on the control point, we define two circles tangent to the control point on either side of the
		stroke.</p>
		<p>The 3D mesh is generated by sweeping the slices generated by the linear morph about the spine. A
		series of translations and rotations are used to orient the slices at evenly spaced positions about the
		spine. The rotation is reliant on using the canvas normal crossed with the tangent of the spine to get
		the binormal - this along with the canvas normal define the plane within which the rotation occurs.
		We use the original distance from the spine as a radius and the original distance along the spine to
		determine the rotational center.</p>
		<p>While computing the positions needed to draw the mesh, we also compute the coloring to shade the
		model. We compute both per-vertex and per-face colors. The per-face coloring is used to shade the
		mesh with flat shading, and the per-vertex coloring allows us to shade the mesh with Gouraud
		shading. The color of the vertices for each slice is computed by linearly interpolating between red and
		green over the 180 degree sweep. Additionally, the end caps of the sweep are textured with a
		hatching pattern. This is accomplished by overlaying an image on the polyloop that defines the end
		slices. The image is positioned by computing texture coordinates for each vertex. The texture
		coordinates are computed by building a reference frame in the plane of the polygon, and every point
		of the polygon is then projected onto those axes to find the coordinates in the new frame.</p>
		<p>
		To show the mesh as a wire frame, we draw edges between the points of the mesh instead of filling
		the triangles. Back-facing edges are colored in a light gray. We determine which edges are back facing
		by comparing the normal of that edge’s face with the direction of the vector from the eye to that
		edge. If the dot-product of those two vectors is negative, then that face is back-facing. Although our
		application colors the culled edges a lighter color, it does not check for the occlusion of front-facing
		edges.</p>
