		<h3>Languages That I have worked extensively in</h3>
		<p><span style="padding-left:2em">C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, MATLAB, MEL script, Pascal, Python, R, SQL.</span> 
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">I have delivered software products professionally in C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Pascal, Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Visual Basic since 1992.</span>
		<br><span style="padding-left:2em">I have TA'ed classes at Tech that required expertise in C, C++, Java, OpenGL, and Python.</span>  
		<br><br>I have implemented numerous stable applications where cross-platform execution was required such as Java calling C++ via JNI, Java calling MATLAB via Java Matlab Interface, 
		C++ simulation code calling and managing MATLAB to collect and format simulation data, Python web server calling and managing R environments and scripts which then 
		interact with various SQL servers, and others.  <br>
		<br>I've used various Machine Learning libraries in Matlab, Python, Java or C++, such as Weka (Java) to work with supervised learning tasks, 
		SHARK (C++) to perform randomized optimization, (specifically unimodal CMA-ES), MatConvNet and Torch for Computer Vision/Deep Learning, particularly convolutional nets and LSTMs,
		and SOMOCLU (C++) to build self organized maps.<br>
		<br>I've implemented a full Kinect Library in C++ that included IK, voice recognition, hand state tracking (via my own implementation of a Neural Net w/Back Propagation) 
		and a suite of Kinect-friendly UI constructs such as sliders, levers, buttons, textboxes and check boxes.</p>
